# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...

      // Remove tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
      tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
      // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
      tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
      // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
      tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,

      // Other configs...
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...
      // Enable lint rules for React
      reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'],
      // Enable lint rules for React DOM
      reactDom.configs.recommended,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])
```

## 🌸 What is YouMatter?

**YouMatter** is a free, judgment-free AI mental health companion and health report interpreter built for everyone — especially students, young adults, and anyone navigating the maze of modern healthcare without a guide.

We believe two things deeply:

> **1. Mental health support should never be a luxury.**
> **2. No one should feel lost looking at their own lab report.**

YouMatter bridges both gaps with a warm, human-first AI experience powered by cutting-edge language models — wrapped in a design that feels like a hug, not a hospital.

## 🎨 Design Language

YouMatter's visual identity is built around **softness, warmth, and trust** — inspired by the logo's lavender-human and blue-AI silhouettes forming a heart together.

```
Colors ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Primary Lavender   #C4B5F4   ████  Warmth, calm, human
  Soft Blue          #93C5FD   ████  Technology, clarity
  Blush Pink         #F4A8C0   ████  Empathy, care
  Warm Peach         #FBBF9A   ████  Energy, optimism
  Deep Navy          #2D2350   ████  Stability, trust

Typography ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Display  →  Playfair Display (emotional, editorial)
  Body     →  Nunito (warm, friendly, highly readable)

Shapes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Pill buttons · Cloud-like cards · Glass morphism surfaces
  No sharp corners. Anywhere. Ever.
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase account (free) → [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- An Anthropic API key → [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a4e-team/youmatter.git
cd youmatter
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Set up the database

```bash
# Run the schema in your Supabase SQL editor, or:
npx supabase db push
```

Or paste the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` directly into your Supabase SQL editor.

### 5. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — you should see YouMatter's landing page. 🌸

## 🗄️ Database Schema

```sql
-- Core tables (all with Row Level Security enabled)

profiles          -- User profiles (extends Supabase Auth)
  └── id, name, age, created_at

lab_reports       -- Uploaded lab PDFs and AI analysis
  └── id, user_id, file_url, raw_text, parameters (jsonb), summary, created_at

chat_sessions     -- Mental health chat sessions
  └── id, user_id, title, created_at

chat_messages     -- Individual messages in a session
  └── id, session_id, role (user|assistant), content, created_at

mood_logs         -- Daily mood check-ins
  └── id, user_id, mood, score, note, created_at

journal_entries   -- Private journal entries
  └── id, user_id, title, content, mood, tags, created_at
```

> 🔒 All tables have **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled. Users can only ever access their own data.

---

## 🤖 AI Prompt Architecture

YouMatter uses two core AI prompts, carefully engineered for safety and empathy:

### Aasha — Mental Health Companion

```
System: You are Aasha, a compassionate AI mental health companion.
You are trained in CBT and mindfulness. You listen, validate, and guide.

Rules:
- Never diagnose. Never prescribe.
- On crisis signals → immediately surface iCall (9152987821)
  and Vandrevala Foundation (1860-2662-345)
- Keep responses warm, 2-4 sentences, end with an open question
- Ground responses in evidence-based techniques
```

### Lab Report Interpreter

```
System: You are a medical lab report interpreter.

Output: Structured JSON with:
  - parameters[]: name, value, unit, range, status, plain-English explanation
  - summary: 3-sentence overview in simple language
  - doctor_questions: 3 questions to ask at next appointment

Rules:
- Never diagnose. Always "consult your doctor."
- Flag critical values clearly but calmly
- Output ONLY valid JSON
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Privacy

YouMatter was built with safety as a first principle, not an afterthought.

- 🔒 **End-to-end data isolation** — Supabase RLS ensures users only ever see their own data
- 🚫 **Zero data selling** — we never monetize user health data
- 🆘 **Crisis detection** — keyword monitoring surfaces emergency resources immediately
- 📋 **Clear disclaimers** — every AI output is clearly labelled as non-medical advice
- 🗂️ **Private PDF storage** — lab reports stored in private Supabase buckets, never public
- ⚖️ **Terms & Privacy** — full legal coverage via Termly (free tier)

**Emergency Resources (always accessible):**

| Helpline | Number |
|---|---|
| iCall (India) | 9152987821 |
| Vandrevala Foundation | 1860-2662-345 |
| Snehi | 044-24640050 |
| NIMHANS | 080-46110007 |
